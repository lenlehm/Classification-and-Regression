    "Neural networks have often been in the news and literally experienced a hype because of that. Many companies and people fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will eventually lead to machines taking over the world. This scenario is called *technological singularity* [1] and many famous people like Elon Musk or the deceased Stephen Hawkins warn about AI. [2] There also have been many popular movies depicting this machine dominating future such as *I Robot, Terminator, Ex Machina* and co. \n",
    "However, the most frequent use-case of neural networks are still classification and regression problems. <br />\n",
    "The rise of Deep Neural Networks emerged in 2012, where the winner of 2012 scored tremendous results on the *[ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](http://image-net.org)* by almost halving the Top-5-Error. [3] <br /> \n",
    "Keep in mind that the Error for this challenge almost remained constant over the last years. This challenge focuses on object classification and localization with over 200 distinct objects, in fact an image recognition task. This breakthrough in 2012 lead to rapid advances in AI, especially Image Classification, where only 3 years later, in 2015, human performance was already achieved. [3] <br />\n",
    "This rapid progress was utilized for similiar fields such as Regression or classification of non-images across every industry branch. [3] <br />\n",
    "Nowadays, these algorithms are used to detect cancer in medical images, or to perceive the environment of various agents, such as Autonomous Cars/ Drones or even robots. [3] <br />\n",
    "Classification is different from regression problems in the sense that algorithm's result can only take values across the classes that means to be classified. Hence, Linear Regression is not suitable for classification tasks, that is why this work focuses on Logistic Regression as well as Neural Networks (NN) for the classification of Credit Card data. <br />\n",
    "Neural networks are a subfield of Artifical Intelligence and these algorithms model a complex function to represent the dataset that was given during training. During training the model learns the correlation of the input and its corresponding output. These trained models are then used to predict new, unknown datapoints that need to be classified. <br />\n",
    "Another advantage of Neural Networks is that they are also neat for Regression problems, thus this work will make use of Neural Networks as well Logistic Regression for Classification and Regression. <br />\n",
    "Both of these methods are supervised learning techniques, where a dataset comprising inputs and its corresponding targets/ outputs are necessary. The algorithm learns from the input corresponding target for each of the datapoints given. The targets differentiate for classification problems and regression problems, i.e. classification targets are discrete variables like the class names, such as *Cat* or *Dog*, when classifying images for cat or dog images repectively. Targets for regression problems are numerical values such as Stock market prices or housing prices.\n",

    "Since this work will make us of *Logistic Regression* as well as *Neural Networks*, the mathematical foundations for each of this algorithms is explained in the following section. <br />\n",
    "Furthermore, the second part of this project deals with Regression, where the two above mentioned algorithms are tested against the common Regression methods such as *Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge* and *Lasso*. I explained those in my [first project](https://github.com/lenlehm/Regression-and-Resampling/blob/master/RegressionAnalysisAndResampling.ipynb), so feel free to refresh those if you feel like it. <br />\n",

    "### 2.1) Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression can be considered a special case of linear regression with the neat benefit of simple probabilistic results for classification. Such a model specifies that an appropriate function of the fitted probability of the event is a linear function of the observed values $X$ of the available predictors $p$.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this simple model cannot properly deal with the problems of non-linear and interactive effects of the predictor variables, such as normalization of the data. [4]\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "Assuming we have a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(\\boldsymbol{x^{(i)}}, y_i)\\}^n_{i=1}$, where we have $p$ predictors for each data sample $\\boldsymbol{x^{i}} = \\{x^{(i)}_1, \\ldots, x^{(i)}_p\\}$. <br />\n",
    "The output $y_i$ are discrete values and can take values from $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, K-1$, for $K$ classes. <br />\n",
    "Classification problems try to predict the output classes $k_i$ for the given $n$ samples comprising the $p$ predictors. <br />\n",
    "Logistic Regression usually handles *binary classification* problems by assigning a probability to each of the two classes, thus meaning there are only two possible outcomes/ classes $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ with each a probability of $p(y|x) \\in \\{0, \\ldots, 1\\}$. The following of this section will be according to the *binary classification* problem.\n",
    "Let $p(y|x)$ denote the probabilty of the outcome $y$ given $x$, then the logistic model reads as follows: <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(y=1 | \\boldsymbol{x}, \\beta) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}}}, \\tag{1}\n",

    "The paramters of the mode are denoted with $\\beta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)$. \n",
    "The term $\\beta \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x} = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^p \\beta_k x_k$ is known as the log-odds and the following function is called the *sigmoid* of $x$: <br />\n",

The model is fit by calculating the gradients and thus finding the optimal parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the cost function $C(X, m(\\theta)$. <br /> \n",

During this time there prevailed a cash and credit card debt crisis. An insanely smart decision [IRONY] from Taiwanese banks was to issue cash and credit cards even to unqualified applicants just to increase their market share. <br /> \n",

In order to not have a biased classifier, this work uses *undersampling* as technique of balancing the dataset, i.e. picking randomly the same amount of the minority class (in our case 6.636).

A great approach is using Cross Validation to figure out a great value of $\\lambda$, however since I have severe time problems, this work isn't focusing on the perfect Logistic Regression parameters for this dataset. <br />"

    "The above two cells wonderfully show how sensitive a neural network is by just changing some hyperparameters such as the activation function, learning rate $\\tau$ or regularization strength $\\lambda$ (see Fig. 6 and 7). <br /> \n",
    "In the plot above, everything remained the same, instead of using ReLU activations the anetwork above makes use of a combination of Sigmoid and tanh activation functions. Resulting in exploding and/or vanishing gradients, since the network didn't learn anything (accuracy of 18%). <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the learning rate also determines the success of convergence for the neural network. If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too small, it takes years until it converges (if enough epochs are set). If the learning rate $\\tau$ is too high, the algotihm can't converge at all, since it is only bouncing around and not resulting in a (global) optimum. [8] <br />\n",
    "Analogously, when the regularization strength $\\lambda$ is too high, the algorithm is penalzing too much ending up in a bad model and thus bad accuracy. Obviously, if $\\lambda$ is too low it is like not penalzing at all and thus also getting a bad model with a bad accuracy score. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are just some few out of many parameters in a neural networks to tune. There are multiple more, like batch size, number of epochs, number of hidden layers, number of neurons and multiple more. <br /> \n",
    "Hence, one can conclude that neural networks are really sensitive to parameter changes along with a tedious search for optimal hyperparameters. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering Logistic Regression in the beginning of this work, there were similiar results achieved without having to tune some critical parameters. <br /> \n",
    "Moreover, Logistic Regression's accuracy basically stayed the same even when changing its regularization parameter $\\lambda$, which makes it even more robust compared to the sensitive neural networks. <br />\n",
    "Due to its simplicity in implementation, faster convergence and no tedious hyperparameter search Logistic Regression should prefered over Neural Networks for this dataset. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is to mention that when properly tuning the Neural Network hyperparameters with Bayesian Analysis [3], it is possible to further boost the Neural Network's accuracy, however this comes to the cost of a more complex implementation as well as computational power and time (= both of which I do not have). <br /> "

    "As mentioned in the theoretical part of Neural Networks, they can either be used for Regression or Classification (as done above). The Classification utilizes the cross entropy, equation (30), as a loss function. The neat benefit of the cross-entropy loss is that it is a convex function, meaning a local minimum is also automatically a global minimum. This is awesome for our minimization problem, since it is sure to find the global minimum of our function and thus the best result. <br /> \n",
    "In classification there is a very particular set of possible output values, the possibles classes. Hence, Mean-Squared Error (MSE), equation (29), is badly defined, as it does not have this kind of knowledge and in turn penalizes errors in an incompatible way. However, in Regression where the goal is to predict a continuous value, MSE gives a great indicator how far apart the predicted value to the true value is. <br />"

    "This work expanded on Logistic Regression and Neural Networks, especially Multi-Layered Perceptrons (MLP). <br />\n",
    "As seen in the first part of this work, where credit card data has been successfully classified, MLP slightly outperformed Logistic Regression, but took longer to converge along with a tedious hyperparameter search. <br /> \n",
    "Taken into account that my Notebook has limited computing power - Intel Core i7, 7th generation, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD - there was the bare minimum of hyperparameter search done for the MLP. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are essential parameters to this algorihtm, which need to be tuned to end up in an optimal solution. These hyperparameters include the learning rate $\\tau$, batch sizes, regularization parameter $\\lambda$, amount of hidden layers, amount of neurons within each layer, activation functions, epochs and optimizer (SGD or Adam). <br /> \n",
    "Hence, there is even more potential for MLP with the given credit card dataset, when performing a hyperparameter search by using either random search or Bayesian Analysis. [3] <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion Logistic Regression is to be prefered for this classification dataset due to its simplicity and time benefits by almost the same accuracy. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "The neat benefit of neural networks is that they are also useful for Regression tasks, as shown in the second part of the project. By only changing the Loss function from Cross Entropy to MSE, the same algorithm can now predict a continuous value as seen in the terrain dataset above. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the Neural Network as a regressor to the common regression methods such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso Regression, one can tell that the common regression methods, especially OLS and Ridge Regression achieved remarkably good results (see the Table four cells above). <br />\n",
    "Nevertheless, the neural network still outperformed both of those Regression methods, since it can model even more complex shapes. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in a nutshell, neural networks are flexible and adaptive tools, which in turn need a lot of fine tuning and hyperparameter search. For both tasks, Regression and Classification, it challenged the performance of its competitors such as OLS, Ridge and Logistic Regression. <br />\n",
    "These benefits however, come at the cost of computational power and complexity for searching optimal parametrization values. <br /> "

    "This work shows that it is possible to get similiar results for Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network of Yeh and Lien. [4] <br /> \n",
    "When it comes to classify the credit card data, the neural networks were similiar in accuracy than its rival, Logistic Regression, only with the drawback of a more complex implementation as well as sensitive hyperparameters. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering Regression on the terrain dataset, Neural Networks are also comparable to the OLS and Ridge Regression in terms of accuracy. Again, its complexity and sensitivity are more of a problem for these easier problems. <br /> \n",

    "## 6.) Further Work \n",
    "\n",
    "As the section about the Classification dataset in the Introduction already states, the dataset itself has some values that are not documented. Manually checking and cleaning the dataset that it follows its documentation would most probably lead to better results. <br /> \n",
    "Going further, one could perform feature engineering to enhance the dataset by adding some more predictor variables to it and thus boosting the accuracies for the classification algorithms at hand. <br /> \n",
    "Leveraging this technique along with utilizing other classification algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines, i.e. AdaBoost, it would be interesting to compare those methods in terms of accuracies and performance. According to the authors [4], these methods revealed promising results and digging deeper into these techniques could yield even better results. <br /> \n",
    "Another interesting approach would be combining this dataset with another credit card default dataset, such as the [German one from before 2000](https://github.com/olethrosdc/ml-society-science/tree/master/data/credit) to end up in one huge dataset, or comparing the different nations to one another and deriving some insights with respect to the banks handing out credits. <br /> \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to Regression, it would be more interesting to compare the common Regression methods to the neural networks for higher dimensional datasets such as the [Boston House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices). Since the common Regression methods could pretty much perfectly predict the elevation of the terrain data, having a multi-dimensional dataset would definitely reveal some more interesting properties for both, Neural Networks and Ridge Regression. <br />\n"
