    "Neural networks have often been in the news and literally experienced a hype because of that. Many companies and people fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will eventually lead to machines taking over the world. This scenario is called *technological singularity* [1] and many famous people like Elon Musk or the deceased Stephen Hawkins warn about AI. [2] There also have been many popular movies depicting this machine dominating future such as *I Robot, Terminator, Ex Machina* and co. \n",
    "However, the most frequent use-case of neural networks are still classification and regression problems. <br />\n",
    "The rise of Deep Neural Networks emerged in 2012, where the winner of 2012 scored tremendous results on the *[ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](http://image-net.org)* by almost halving the Top-5-Error. [3] <br /> \n",
    "Keep in mind that the Error for this challenge almost remained constant over the last years. This challenge focuses on object classification and localization with over 200 distinct objects, in fact an image recognition task. This breakthrough in 2012 lead to rapid advances in AI, especially Image Classification, where only 3 years later, in 2015, human performance was already achieved. [3] <br />\n",
    "This rapid progress was utilized for similiar fields such as Regression or classification of non-images across every industry branch. [3] <br />\n",
    "Nowadays, these algorithms are used to detect cancer in medical images, or to perceive the environment of various agents, such as Autonomous Cars/ Drones or even robots. [3] <br />\n",
    "Classification is different from regression problems in the sense that algorithm's result can only take values across the classes that means to be classified. Hence, Linear Regression is not suitable for classification tasks, that is why this work focuses on Logistic Regression as well as Neural Networks (NN) for the classification of Credit Card data. <br />\n",
    "Neural networks are a subfield of Artifical Intelligence and these algorithms model a complex function to represent the dataset that was given during training. During training the model learns the correlation of the input and its corresponding output. These trained models are then used to predict new, unknown datapoints that need to be classified. <br />\n",
    "Another advantage of Neural Networks is that they are also neat for Regression problems, thus this work will make use of Neural Networks as well Logistic Regression for Classification and Regression. <br />\n",
    "Both of these methods are supervised learning techniques, where a dataset comprising inputs and its corresponding targets/ outputs are necessary. The algorithm learns from the input corresponding target for each of the datapoints given. The targets differentiate for classification problems and regression problems, i.e. classification targets are discrete variables like the class names, such as *Cat* or *Dog*, when classifying images for cat or dog images repectively. Targets for regression problems are numerical values such as Stock market prices or housing prices.\n",

    "Since this work will make us of *Logistic Regression* as well as *Neural Networks*, the mathematical foundations for each of this algorithms is explained in the following section. <br />\n",
    "Furthermore, the second part of this project deals with Regression, where the two above mentioned algorithms are tested against the common Regression methods such as *Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge* and *Lasso*. I explained those in my [first project](https://github.com/lenlehm/Regression-and-Resampling/blob/master/RegressionAnalysisAndResampling.ipynb), so feel free to refresh those if you feel like it. <br />\n",

    "### 2.1) Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression can be considered a special case of linear regression with the neat benefit of simple probabilistic results for classification. Such a model specifies that an appropriate function of the fitted probability of the event is a linear function of the observed values $X$ of the available predictors $p$.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this simple model cannot properly deal with the problems of non-linear and interactive effects of the predictor variables, such as normalization of the data. [4]\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "Assuming we have a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(\\boldsymbol{x^{(i)}}, y_i)\\}^n_{i=1}$, where we have $p$ predictors for each data sample $\\boldsymbol{x^{i}} = \\{x^{(i)}_1, \\ldots, x^{(i)}_p\\}$. <br />\n",
    "The output $y_i$ are discrete values and can take values from $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, K-1$, for $K$ classes. <br />\n",
    "Classification problems try to predict the output classes $k_i$ for the given $n$ samples comprising the $p$ predictors. <br />\n",
    "Logistic Regression usually handles *binary classification* problems by assigning a probability to each of the two classes, thus meaning there are only two possible outcomes/ classes $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ with each a probability of $p(y|x) \\in \\{0, \\ldots, 1\\}$. The following of this section will be according to the *binary classification* problem.\n",
    "Let $p(y|x)$ denote the probabilty of the outcome $y$ given $x$, then the logistic model reads as follows: <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(y=1 | \\boldsymbol{x}, \\beta) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}}}, \\tag{1}\n",

    "The paramters of the mode are denoted with $\\beta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)$. \n",
    "The term $\\beta \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x} = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^p \\beta_k x_k$ is known as the log-odds and the following function is called the *sigmoid* of $x$: <br />\n",

The model is fit by calculating the gradients and thus finding the optimal parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the cost function $C(X, m(\\theta)$. <br /> \n",

An insanely smart decision [IRONY] from Taiwanese banks was to issue cash and credit cards even to unqualified applicants just to increase their market share. <br /> \n",

    "The takeaway from Fig. 3 is that the algorithm is really sensitive to the $\\lambda$ parametrization, so be careful which values to use. A great approach is using Cross Validation to figure out a great value of $\\lambda$, however since I have severe time problems, this work isn't focusing on the perfect Logistic Regression parameters for this dataset. <br />"

    "Moreover, there is an addition to the ROC curve, calles *Area under ROC Curve (AUC)*, which represents the area underneath the 2D ROC curve (can be thought of as the integral of the ROC curve). <br /> \n",
    "AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. <br />\n",
    "AUC is a commonly used metrics to evaluate a classification algorithm due to its scale - and classification threshold invariance. <br /> It measures how well predictions are ranked rather than their absolut values (scale-invariant) and the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold was chosen (classification-threshold-invariant). <br />\n",

    "Additionally, there is a positive correlation among the polynomial degree and the Error measurement: the higher the polynomial degree, the smaller the MSE or the higher the R2 score, respectively. <br /> \n",
    "Comparing the scores with the generated Franke function data, we could observe similiar behavior for the algorithms. Ridge and OLS can basically achieve same scores on both datasets unlike Lasso. Lasso was always worse than both methods, sometimes even significant deviations between Lasso and the other two types. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, by shuffling the data one could ameliorate the model performance from 0.00238 to 0.00145 (values taken from Appendix). <br /> \n",
    "Nevertheless, a MSE of 0.00238 is already pretty good, but by enabling data shuffling it is possible to achieve an about 50% better score of the model with no real effort. <br />"

    "As the section about the Dataset in the Introduction already states, the dataset itself has some values that are not documented. Manually checking and cleaning the dataset that it follows its documentation would most probably lead to better results. Going further, one could perform feature engineering to enhance the dataset by adding some more predictor variables to it and thus boosting the accuracies for the classification algorithms at hand. <br /> \n",
    "Leveraging this technique along with utilizing other classification algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines, i.e. AdaBoost, it would be interesting to see how this would affect the accuracies. According to the authors [4], these methods revealed promising results and digging deeper into these techniques could yield even better results. <br /> \n",
    "Another interesting approach would be combining this dataset with another credit card default dataset, such as the [German one from before 2000](https://github.com/olethrosdc/ml-society-science/tree/master/data/credit) to end up in one huge dataset, or comparing the different nations to one another and deriving some insights with respect to the banks handing out credits. <br /> \n"
